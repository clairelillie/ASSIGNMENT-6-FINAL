# ASSIGNMENT 6 
Our escape room experience has a scifi-theme, with four unique puzzles that are well-suited for VR. The purple light strips on the floor use a custom shader similar to the one we built in assn 5. The game is won if all rooms are completed, and lost if a user gets stuck and cannot complete a puzzle. The first room has audio when playing the xylophone.

Walkthrough:  
In the birthday room, there are presents, balloons, and cake on 3 of the tables. The fourth has a simple xylophone. Play the xylophone by hitting the keys with the controllers. Play "Happy Birthday" to open the door (red, red, yellow, red, blue, green).

In the combination lock room, pick up and rotate the objects to find a number, and enter them in the perscribed order on the keypad.  
In the clock room, there are two items on each table. Tap on the hour hand on the clock 2 times with the controller.  
In the color room, there are colored tiles on the floor. Step on the tiles in the order of the colors on the wall.
